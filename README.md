# Machine Learning Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Keras library. The dataset used is the popular MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits with a size of 28x28 pixels.

## How the Learning Algorithm Works

1. **Preprocessing**: The input images are preprocessed, which involves resizing, inverting the color, and normalizing the pixel values. This step
